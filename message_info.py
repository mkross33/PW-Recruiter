subject = "You should totally join Blackfyre!"

body = """ Hey you! Want to join one of the longest reigning communities in Politics and War? Blackfyre functions as a training alliance for Seven Kingdoms, an alliance that has prospered since the first day of the game. 

Blackfyre funds all members to city 12, and after promotion to Seven Kingdoms, allows all members the opportunity to participate in the alliance, whether it be a role as a diplomat or planning military strategy. The first step is to go to the Blackfyre alliance page (https://politicsandwar.com/alliance/id=5243) and join the Seven Kingdoms Discord server linked there. A government member will be with you shortly to get you settled in :)

Politics and War is a game, so what's most important is that you have fun. No matter where you go, we here at Blackfyre and Seven Kingdoms hope that you have as much fun as possible, and, well, hope that you join us ;)"""
